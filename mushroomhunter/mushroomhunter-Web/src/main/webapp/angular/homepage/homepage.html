                This is a school project, goal is to develop a simple mushroom hunter portal where mushroom hunters can exchange information about locations rich for mushrooms and also locations that are poor for mushrooms. The mushroom hunter has these attributes: the firstname, the surname, the nickname. A forest has the name, the nearest city and the description of its locality. A visit of the forest is a relationship between a mushroom hunter and a forest and is described by a date of visit and note (e.g. "it was very dry, no mushrooms found"). A mushroom has the name, the type (edible, unedible, poisonous), the start of the occurence and the end of the occurence. The mushroom catalogue should be searchable, filterable and sortable.
