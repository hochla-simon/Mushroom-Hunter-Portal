======================

PA165 Team Project - Mushroom Hunter Portal

Task Description
----------------
This is a school project, goal is to develop a simple mushroom hunter portal 
where mushroom hunters can exchange information about locations rich for 
mushrooms and also locations that are poor for mushrooms. The mushroom hunter 
has these attributes: the firstname, the surname, the nickname. A forest has the
name, the nearest city and the description of its locality. A visit of the
forest is a relationship between a mushroom hunter and a forest and is
described by a date of visit and note (e.g. "it was very dry, no mushrooms 
found"). A mushroom has the name, the type (edible, unedible, poisonous), the 
start of the occurrence and the end of the occurrence. The mushroom catalogue 
should be searchable, filterable and sortable.
